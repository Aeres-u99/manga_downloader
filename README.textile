h1. Manga Downloader

Manga Downloader is a Windows/Linux python script that does what it says.  
Currently supports otakuworks.com and mangareader.net, with a total of over 3500 mangas.
Downloads into .cbz format, can optionally download into .zip instead.
Untested on Mac OS.

h2. Usage

@-a@
Downloads all chapters that have been released.

@-d {download path}@
Must be enclosed in double quotes.  Default behavior is to use current working directory.  

@-f@
Downloads chapters to a new directory in the current directory with the manga's name.

@-n {name of manga}@
Must be enclosed in double quotes.

@-o@
Overwrites downloaded chapters if it already exists.  Default behavior is to skip over it.

@-z@
Downloads into .zip format instead of .cbz

The script will output a list of all chapters of the series it has found on OtakuWorks.  When it prompts "Download which chapters?", type in the ones you want delimited by '-' and ','. You can also type 'all' if you did not specify -a before.  See Notes for an example of an acceptable input.
