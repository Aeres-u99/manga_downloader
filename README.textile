h1. Manga Downloader

Manga Downloader is a Windows/Linux python script that does what it says for mangavolume.com
Downloads into .cbz format, can optionally download into .zip instead.
Untested on Mac OS.

h2. Usage

@-a@
Downloads all chapters that have been released.  Takes precedence over @-e / -s@ if used together.

@-d {download path}@
Quotes are optional if there are no spaces or if escaping spaces with a backslash.  Default behavior is to use current working directory.  

@-e {ending chapter}@
Should be used in conjunction with @-s@, will default to latest chapter if @-e@ is omitted but @-s@ is specified.

@-n {name of manga}@
Must be enclosed in double quotes.

@-o@
Overwrites downloaded chapters if it already exists.  Default behavior is to skip over it.

@-s {starting chapter}@
Should be used in conjunction with @-e@, will default to chapter 1 if @-s@ is omitted but @-e@ is specified.

@-z@
Downloads into .zip format instead of .cbz

h3. Notes

If neither @-a@ or the combination of @-e / -s@ is used, the downloader will default to @-a@ behavior.

Usage examples:

@manga.py -n 'Air Gear' -d 'C:\Documents and Settings\admin\Documents\Manga\'@
On a Windows machine, downloads 'Air Gear' to C:\Documents and Settings\admin\Documents\Manga\ from chapter 1 to latest, using .cbz compression

@./manga.py -n 'Air Gear' -s 20 -d ~/Manga/ -z -o@
On a Linux/Unix machine, downloads 'Air Gear' to ~/Manga from chapter 20 to latest, using .zip compression and overwriting previously downloaded chapters

Quotes can either be single or double quotes.  

h2. Bugs

* Program crash if user specifies chapter 0 as starting chapter and it doesn't exist.

h2. Issues

* Animea forces downloading of source code on every page due to unpredictable image filenames, forcing an overhead of about 100 kB/page.
* "IOError: [Errno socket error] [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer" after downloading a series of images from Animea - much slower download rate then MV and CV...remove as a source?
* Code is extremely disorganized.
