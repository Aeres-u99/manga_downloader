h1. Manga Downloader

Manga Downloader is a cross-platform Windows/Mac/Linux python script that does what it says.  
Currently supports mangafox.com, mangareader.net, and otakuworks.com, with a total of over 5000 mangas.
Downloads into .cbz format, can optionally download into .zip instead.

h2. Usage

@-a@
Downloads all chapters that have been released.

@-d {download path}@
Must be enclosed in double quotes.  Default behavior is to use current working directory.  

@-f@
Downloads chapters to a new directory in the current directory with the manga's name.

@-n {name of manga}@
Must be enclosed in double quotes.

@-o@
Overwrites downloaded chapters if it already exists.  Default behavior is to skip over it.

@-x {xmlFile}@
Parses XML File for the following infomration: Manga Name, Host Site, Last Chapter Downloaded, and Directory Path

@-z@
Downloads into .zip format instead of .cbz
	
The script will output a list of all chapters of the series it has found on the site you selected.  When it prompts "Download which chapters?", type in the ones you want delimited by '-' and ','. You can also type 'all' if you did not specify -a before.  

See Notes for an example of an acceptable input.

h2. Bugs

* Input between the two prompts "Which site?" and "Download which chapters?" when the user is not supposed to may cause program crash.

h2. Issues

* Careful! MangaFox sometimes leaves up invalid chapters that it has marked for deletion.  Be suspicious of out-of-order chapters if they appear.
* Chapter numbering on MangaReader doesn't pad, i.e. 1, 2, 3 as opposed to 001, 002, 003.  If this is consistent, patch will be coming in next release.
* Code hasn't been tested on Windows in a while.
